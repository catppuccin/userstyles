### Requesting Userstyles

To request a website to be themed, please create a [Port Request](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/discussions/new?category=port-requests) discussion on [catppuccin/catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).
While this may seem odd, this ensures to keep all of our requests in one place and makes it easier for
all people to request what they want without needing to learn what "Stylus" exactly is.

**If you have already created a userstyle, please raise a [Pull Request](https://github.com/catppuccin/userstyles/compare)!**

### Creating Userstyles

Creating userstyles should be very simple if you follow the instructions given below:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch under the name `feat/<name-of-website>`, (e.g. `feat/nixos-search` instead of NixOS Search).
3. Create a new folder `styles/<name-of-website>`. The name must be `lower-kebab-case`.
4. Copy the contents of the [`template`](../template/) folder into `styles/<name-of-website>`.
5. Edit the [`catppuccin.user.css`]() file and replace all the words wrapped with `<>` to fit the details of your port.
6. Edit the [`userstyle.yml`]() file and put in the details of your port. **More details given below.**
7. Create your image previews in the [`assets/`]() folder
   - **All previews must be `.webp` files.**
   - Create a preview image for each flavor. (e.g. `mocha.webp`, `macchiato.webp`, `frappe.webp` & `latte.webp`)
   - Use [catwalk](https://github.com/catppuccin/toolbox#catwalk) to generate a composite or grid image of all the flavors. **This must be saved as `catwalk.webp`.**
8. Raise a [Pull Request](https://github.com/catppuccin/userstyles/compare), making sure to read and fill out the template properly.

### `userstyles.yml`

Please note that the `README`'s for each port are auto-generated by scripts defined in [`src/generate`](../src/generate), along with many other parts of this repository.
This file, `userstyles.yml`, is responsible for holding the necessary data to auto-generate everything.

[`userstyles.schema.json`](../src/userstyles.schema.json) is the schema specification for this file. The fields in the following instructions are based on the schema:

1. Add your name to the list of maintainers.

   ```yaml
   maintainers:
     - &<github-username>
     name: <your name, this is optional>
     url: https://github.com/<github-username>
   ```

2. Locate the `userstyles` section and add your port to the list.

   You should make changes to everything wrapped in `<>` and remove the `<>` characters.
   If you need help with any of the fields, you should refer to other ports in the `userstyle.yml` file.
   If you still cannot figure it out, you can ask for help in the pull request or join our [Discord](https://discord.com/servers/catppuccin-907385605422448742).

   `Only Required Fields:`

   ```yaml
    <port>:
      name: <name>
      category: <category>
      readme:
        app-link: <url>
        maintainers: [ *<github-username> ]
   ```

   `All Fields:`

   These extra `usage` & `faq` fields will ensure that you can add important information about the port to the README.
   Do note that they are **optional**.

   ```yaml
    <port>:
      name: <name>
      category: <category>
      color: <color>
      icon: <icon>
      readme:
        app-link: "<url>"
        usage: |+
          > **Note** <br>
          > <your notes>
        faq:
          - question: <question>
            answer: <answer>
        maintainers: [ *<github-userame> ]
   ```
