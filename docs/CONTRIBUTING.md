  on your fork for your specific PR.
- Catppuccin uses the [Conventional Commits
  ](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for creating explicit and meaningful commit messages. This repository requires pull request _titles_ to be in the conventional commit format, however we do not require it for individual commits within a pull request.
- Update the version in the `==UserStyle==` header of the `catppuccin.user.css` file. This is to enable version control of the style.
- If it's your first time contributing to a project then you should look to the
  popular
  [first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
  repository on GitHub. This will give you hands-on experience with the features
  of GitHub required to make a contribution. As always, feel free to join our
  [Discord](https://discord.com/servers/catppuccin-907385605422448742) to ask
  any questions and clarify your understanding, we are more than happy to help!
