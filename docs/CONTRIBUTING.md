# Contributing!

ðŸŽ‰ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

## Guidelines

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository. Use
your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull
request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For new userstyles, make sure to see [userstyle-creation.md](./userstyle-creation.md) after reading this.

## Development environment

This repositories uses [Deno](https://deno.com/) extensively for linting and automation. We recommend setting up Deno locally to improve your workflow â€” see ["Installation" - Deno Docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation). With Deno installed locally, you can run the lint script using `deno task lint` (and `deno task lint:fix` to automatically apply fixes) and the formatting script using `deno task format`.

When editing a userstyle, we suggest setting up live reloading so your local changes can be automatically reloaded through Stylus. See ["How can I see my changes in real time?"](./tips-and-tricks.md#how-can-i-see-my-changes-in-real-time).

## Recommendations

### Assessing websites

Some websites are, unfortunately, simply not meant for userstyles. For example, websites that have auto-generated classes (`aeN WR beA nH oy8Mbf`, `cfb2a888`, etc.) lead to unreadable and unmaintainable userstyles â€” they break quickly and are difficult for contributors besides the maintainer to update/maintain. For those reasons we recommend not attempting to theme such sites.

### Root variables

While writing a userstyle, you may have come across [custom properties / CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*), typically wrapped in a `:root` selector. We refer to these variables as "root variables", and they can be thought of as global variables used all across a website. For Catppuccin userstyles, we prefer that these variables are themed (if they exist) rather than individual elements. As the website hopefully uses these variables themselves, it saves yourself a lot of work in theming and maintaining the userstyle.

### Opinionated changes

When writing or updating a userstyle, it is important to keep in mind that different users have different preferences. To avoid lengthy discussion over user interface aesthetics, we have a set of rules for what a userstyle may include; importantly, **changes to font or layout (padding, margin, hiding/moving elements) are prohibited.**

### General recommendations

- Create a [topic branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#_topic_branch) on your fork for your specific PR.
- Catppuccin uses the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  standard for creating explicit and meaningful commit messages. This repository
  requires pull request _titles_ to be in the conventional commit format,
  however we do not require it for individual commits within a pull request.
- Update the version in the `==UserStyle==` header of the `catppuccin.user.css`
  file. This is to enable version control of the style.
- If it's your first time contributing to a project then you should look to the
  popular [first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
  repository on GitHub. This will give you hands-on experience with the features
  of GitHub required to make a contribution. As always, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.com/servers/catppuccin-907385605422448742) to ask
  any questions and clarify your understanding, we are more than happy to help!
- Changes to docs may need to use [marksman](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman) to generate the table of contents.

## Pull request review process

It's better to have a draft pull request than no pull request at all. Having a draft lets others know that a userstyle is being worked on, and gives the opportunity for people to try it out ahead of time (if they really want it themed!).

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[New userstyle];
    B[Other improvements];
    A --> C[Review by userstyles staff];
    B --> D[Review by maintainer];
    C --> E{Feedback};
    D --> F{Feedback};
    E -->|Changes made| E;
    F -->|Changes made| F;
    E -->|Approved by userstyles staff| K;
    F -->|Approved by maintainer or userstyles staff| L[Merged by maintainer];
    K[Waiting period*] --> M[Merged by userstyles staff];
```

\*A waiting period is usually started if a website is particularly complex or for any other reason could not be thoroughly/completely tested. Waiting periods typically last between 1 and 2 days.
