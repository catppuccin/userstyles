        @-moz-document domain("mastodon.social"), domain("mstdn.social"), domain("fosstodon.org"), domain("piaille.fr"), domain("tech.lgbt") {
        ```
        If the theme isn't being applied to your instance, go to the userstyle's **Settings > Custom included sites** and add your instance to the list, for instance, `*://floss.social/*`.
      faq:
        - question: "**The theme does not look the same as the preview?**"
          answer: "Your Mastodon instance may be using its own custom CSS, which is changing the look of the theme."
        - question: "**The theme is not working?**"
          answer: |
            One solution might be changing the theme to either light or dark via **Preferences** > **Appearance** > **Site theme**.
